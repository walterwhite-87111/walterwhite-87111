## Walter H. White 
### About Me
I am a skilled ⚗️ chemist with a doctoral degree from the *California Institute of Technology*.  My research in :electron: X-ray crystallography contributed to a project awarded a **Nobel Prize** in Chemistry in 1985.  After graduating from CalTech, colleague Elliott Schwartz and I co-founded 🧠 **Gray Matter Technologies** which evolved into a multi-billion dollar company.   Soon, I left Gray Matter and held a series of ⚗️ chemical lab technician positions.  I then moved to Albuquerque, NM and a job with Sandia Laboratories.  After leaving Sandia, I joined the faculty at J.P Wynne High School as a 🧪 chemistry teacher and worked a second job at the A1A Car Wash, both in Albuquerque.  Most recently, I launched a 💲 successful business in the pharmaceutical sector with collaborator Jesse Pinkman.
