### Brief Biography
I am a skilled ⚗️ chemist with a doctoral degree from the *California Institute of Technology*.

Soon, I left Gray Matter and held a series of 🥼 chemical lab technician positions including one with **Sandia Laboratories** in 🌶️ Albuquerque, New Mexico.  After leaving Sandia, I joined the faculty at J.P Wynne High School as a 🧪 chemistry teacher and worked a second job at the A1A Car Wash, both in Albuquerque.  Most recently, I launched a 💰 successful business in the pharmaceutical sector with collaborator Jesse Pinkman.
